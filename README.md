# Welcome to HACKTOBERFEST 2023 

This year I have decided to make a game of Boggle whilst learning HTML, CSS & Javascript. 
The basic structure of the game is there, but as I'm only learning, there is plenty of room for improvement. 

Before you get started, make sure you've signed up at the <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com">offical Hacktoberfest website.</a>
